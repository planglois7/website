	<h1>wisdom:</h1>
	<h3>Wisdom comes in many forms. My favorite kinds of wisdom are the little glimmers of knowledge and insight that you underline in books or scribble in your notebook or copy-paste from a website. Below are just a few of those that I find are especially inspiring, funny or true, both professionally and beyond.</h3><br></br>

	<p style="text-align:left;padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;">“Comparing what we’re looking for misses the point. It’s wanting to know that makes us matter.” <br></br><span style="color:#c4d4e0">--Arcadia by Tom Stoppard</span></p>

<p style="text-align:right;padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;">“I just did it because it didn’t occur to me that I couldn’t”<br></br><span style="color:#9aabb9"> -- Erika Bridges</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;">“You're never too old to say "horses" when you drive past some horses” <br></br><span style="color:#e2b49a">--@mattslusser, some guy on Twitter</span></p>

<p style="text-align:right;padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;">"I am made and remade continually. Different people draw different words from me." 
<br></br><span style="color:#e9c77b">-- Virginia Woolf</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;">“Just follow your curiosity -- trust your curiosity.” <br></br><span style="color:#e2b49a">-- Saied Vahidi</span></p>

<p style="text-align:right;padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;">"Now, I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but some day, someone will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now. And to all the little girl whose are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams." <br></br><span style="color:#c4d4e0">--Hillary Clinton</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;">"We're creative people. We're optimistic by nature."<br></br><span style="color:#9aabb9"> --Tracy Wong</span></p><br></br>

<h2 style="color:white">And finally:</h2>
<h3 style="color:white;text-align:center;">I wrote this in an essay at the very end of my senior year of high school. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. Reading it today, I think I made some good choices. 17-year-old Rachel would be proud.</h3><br>

<p style="color:white; text-align:left;padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;font-size:15px">“You see, I don’t know what I want to do with my life. Going into college, I feel myself pulled in a thousand directions. What should I study? English? Business? Journalism? It’s overwhelming.</p>

<p style="color:white;text-align:left;padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;font-size:15px">At the same time, though, I know exactly what I want to do. I’ve learned in this class that the repeated process of stepping outside the box and stretching my limits leads to the ultimate complexity of fulfillment that I’m searching for. Where ideas intersect, life becomes more than the sum of its parts. I want to “make connections” for the rest of my life, because for me, there is meaning in that--it’s a map through the network of allegorical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave">caves</a> that lie ahead. Everything is connected if you look hard enough-- what matters is seeking out those intersections, and making them mean something to you. This class has taught me to seek knowledge, then apply it to what I already know, regardless of what career I choose.</p>

<p style="color:white;text-align:left;padding-left:200px;padding-right:200px;font-size:15px">This year, in this class, I’ve adopted a life goal that accepts the infinite: to seek connections everywhere, and apply the meaning I find to my own life. I’ve learned how to learn, and I’ve learned how to love it, and that’s something that will follow me beyond the walls of Westview.”</p><br></br>
