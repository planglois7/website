	<h2>defining "strategist"</h2>
	<h3>I've heard lots of definitions that try to explain what a strategist actually <em>is</em>. I'm collecting them here:</h3>
	<ol style="font-family: Ambroise, serif;
	text-align:left;
	line-height:32px;
	font-style:normal;
	font-weight:300;">
		<li>“A strategist is a hybrid thinker that brings structure to chaos.” <span>-Erika Bridges + Saied Vahidi</span></li>
		<li>“A strategist wears many hats.” <span>-Natalie Kim</span></li>
		<li>“A strategist finds the real, honest problem to solve.” <span>-Brock Kirby</span></li>
		<li>“A strategist is, most simply, an ethnographer.” <span>-Kunal Merchant</span></li>
		<li>“A strategist uses creativity and research. They have to be critical and proactive. They help people understand.” <span>-Alex Morrison</span></li>
	</ol>
	<h3>So, how do I define it? What is a strategist to me? I think my answer will change, but for now, I see this job as a way to get paid to build and communicate an informed opinion. That’s pretty incredible.</h3>

	<h2>my specialties</h2>
	<h3>I’ve heard many people list the sub-roles of a strategist: all the things you might find yourself doing on the job at some point. This is what Natalie Kim meant when she said a strategist wears “many hats.” Here are just a few of my favorites.</h3>
	<ol style="line-height:1em;">
		<li style="font-size:15px;"><em style="font-size:20px;font-family: Ambroise, serif;font-style:normal;
	font-weight:400;">Creative sparring partner:</em><br></br>
		This is one of my favorites, but also one of the hardest parts about the advertising industry. As a strategist on my NSAC team, I’ve experienced quite a few “sparring matches” with creatives: productive but occasionally heated conversations about the best way to move a project forward. Learning the skills to advocate for my insights while encouraging creativity is one of my biggest lifelong learning tasks on the horizon.</li><br></br>
		<li style="font-size:15px;"><em style="font-size:20px;font-family: Ambroise, serif;font-style:normal;
	font-weight:400;">Futurologist:</em><br></br>
		Alex Morrison inspired me with his “shit you should Google” list: a daily trend check-in to stay on top of our constantly shifting world and culture. I love the idea of being on the forefront of social and industrial change. I want to know what’s going on, and this industry encourages -- even requires -- the pursuit of the next big thing.</li><br></br>
		<li style="font-size:15px;"><em style="font-size:20px;font-family: Ambroise, serif;font-style:normal;
	font-weight:400;">“Numbers person”:</em><br></br>
		I was totally “math girl” in high school. AP Calc, AP Stats -- I did it all. Though I chose to indulge my right brain in college, I still have a knack for logic and numbers. I love the idea of digging through data, then distilling it to make a clear, compelling case for a bigger concept.</li><br></br>
		<li style="font-size:15px;"><em style="font-size:20px;font-family: Ambroise, serif;font-style:normal;
	font-weight:400;">Cultural anthropologist:</em><br></br>
		Anthropology: my other high school nerd obsession. My senior year, I wrote a 30-page ethnography comparing my all-girls a cappella group and our all-boys counterpart. I argued that we were low-level cult-like organizations and it was a blast (ask me about my sorority membership, too. . .). Basically, I am deeply interested in the way people live, work and interact, and I love that strategy is deeply linked with that field of study.</li>
