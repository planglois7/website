	<h2>places I go</h2>
	<h3>Sometimes, to “understand culture,” you have to experience it. Here are a few of the random spots I frequent in my town when I need a boost from art, music or just the world outside my apartment. Will update as I discover new adventure spots:</h3>

	<ul style="font-size:20px;line-height:50px;text-align:center">
		<li>UO Standup Comedy</li>
		<li>Smith Family Books</li>
		<li>The Pocket Playhouse</li>

	<h2>things I read</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/significant-digits/">Significant Digits</a> <span>//<br></br> seeing culture through numbers gives me a fresh perspective.</span>
		</li><br></br>
		<li><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/">The New Yorker</a> <span>//<br></br> Yes, I know it’s a little cliche, but my New Yorker subscription is one of the best purchases I’ve ever made. Browsing great writing on culture, politics and art always jump-starts my creative and strategic processes.</span>
		</li><br></br>
		<li><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/">Brain Pickings</a> <span>//<br></br> Brain Pickings may not seem directly relevant to advertising, but Maria Popova’s brilliant connections between art, science and culture make me want to become a better writer and thinker every time I read her blog. I feel like strategists undergo a similar process to Popova-- taking previously unconnected information and giving it meaning by bringing it together. This blog is a joy.</span>
		</li><br></br>
		<li><a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/">Think with Google</a> <span>//<br></br> Smart, relevant thoughts, moments and trends. Always a good way to tap into what’s happening.</span>
		</li><br></br>
		<li><a href="http://nextdraft.com/current/">NextDraft</a> <span>//<br></br> 10 pieces of “the day’s most fascinating news” from Dave Pell; another quick blast of what’s going on, complete with links and insights for more information.</span>
